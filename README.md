# ukcovid-19
There are plenty of covid dashboards (uk) available but not many that show comparisons at local authority level.
I went for **Plotly Dash** as it was the simplest (& therefore best) to implement - the fact that there are a number of wonderful features (graphs, datatable, date picker) out of the box is a huge plus. Data is stored in **Excel** and is sourced from https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/download.
Although I have included a built in feature to upload data it still needs to be done manually (around 4pm UK when the data is published).
