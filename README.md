# UK Covid-19 Dashboard
There are plenty of covid dashboards (uk) available but not many that show comparisons at local authority level.
I went for **Plotly Dash** as it was the simplest (& therefore best) to implement - the fact that there are a number of wonderful features (graphs, datatable, date picker) out of the box is a bonus. Data is downloaded and stored (app_data_load.py) in **Excel** and is sourced from https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/download.<br><br>

Check it out at https://ukcovid-19.herokuapp.com/<br><br>
